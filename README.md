 ## Git Branch Naming Conventions
>
> ### Branch Categories:
>
> - _feature_ is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
> - _bugfix_ is for fixing a bug
> - _hotfix_ is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
> - _test_ is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket
>
 ## Git Commit Message Pattern

> ### Commit Categories:

> - _build:_ Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example np
> - _docs:_ Documentation only changes
> - _feat:_ A new feature
> - _fix:_ A bug fix
> - _perf:_ A code change that improves performance
> - _refactor:_ A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
> - _style:_ Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
> - _test:_ Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
